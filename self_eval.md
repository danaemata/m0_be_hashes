# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
I struggled with the very last question of the hashes 2 file. I was overthinking the question. I just had to go back to my iteration notes from session 3.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
The note-taking is great. I believe I write great notes that I can reference back to. I take notes during the zoom meeting, self-directed study and while completing assignments.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
First, I like to attempt to solve the problem myself. I always reference back to notes or previous assignments. If I take more than 10 or 15 minutes trying to solve the question, then I use google or youtube. I learned that I'm also a visual learner, so youtube has been helping me!
